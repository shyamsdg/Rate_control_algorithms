### Source code and inspiration

MATLAB code for the Minstrel-HT algorithm was written, keeping the NS3 version of Minstrel-HT in mind. The NS3 version was used to debug and calibarate the performance of the algorithm, and can be found [here](https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/classns3_1_1_minstrel_ht_wifi_manager.html).
