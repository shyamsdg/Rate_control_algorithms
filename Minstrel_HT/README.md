# Overview of Minstrel (nonHT) and Minstrel-HT
 Minstrel (nonHT) and **`Minstrel-HT`** is a rate control algorithm implemented in MadWifi and Linux. 

 The basic principle of  Minstrel (nonHT) is to probe the environment using Frame Success Ratio (FSR) and adapt the rate based on statistics collected about the probability of successful transmission. The algorithm adapts the rate to the highest rate that it considers successful, and spends a fraction of its time doing 'look around' by trying other rates (sampling). 

 Minstrel(nonHT) is appropriate for nonHT/legacy(i.e. 802.11/b/a/g) WiFi configurations. For HT WiFi configurations (i.e. 802.11n or higher), **`Minstrel-HT`** rate adaptation algorithm is to be used. 

 **`Minstrel-HT`** is designed for high-latency devices that implement a Multi Rate Retry (MRR) chain. This kind of device does not give feedback (i.e. open-loop system) for every frame/packet retransmission, but only when a frame/packet is correctly transmitted (an Ack is received) or a frame/packet transmission completely fails (all retransmission attempts fail). 
 
 The MRR chain is used to advise the hardware about which rate to use when re-transmitting a frame/packet. 
 
 In **`Minstrel-HT`**, the Sampling is done differently from nonHT/nonHT/legacy Minstrel. **`Minstrel-HT`** tries to sample all rates in all groups at least once and to avoid many  consecutive samplings.

# Source code and inspiration
Our Minstrel-HT algorithm implementation in MATLAB is inspired from NS3-MinstrelHTWifiManager. The NS3 version is used to debug and calibrate the performance of the MATLAB implementaion.

The NS3 source code can be found [here](https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/classns3_1_1_minstrel_ht_wifi_manager.html).
