    Rate control/adaptation algorithms determines the performance of Wi-Fi networks, depending on the network conditions, the rate changes to achieve better TP.

    There are many external factors that affect the TP of the wireless networks; Traffic congestion, dynamic nature, and Receiver compatibility. 

    Therefore, Rate adaptation is one of the fundamental resource management issues. Which is used to deal with channel dynamicity.

# Running the code
    There is a Matlab code and Live editor code both of same version which is tested and evaluated. 
    The Live editor code has block diagrams for easier understanding of the code.
    To Run the code copy the folder with all the files included.

# Dependencies
    To run the code, below are the required dependencies:
    1. Matlab
    2. WLAN toolbox

# The IISc team
