# Rate_control_algorithm
    Author: Shyam Sundar
    <br/><br/>Rate control/adaptation algorithms determine the performance of Wi-Fi networks, depending on the network conditions, the rate changes to achieve better Throughput (TP).     
    <br/><br/>There are many external factors that affect the TP of the wireless networks: Traffic congestion, dynamic nature, and receiver compatibility. 
    <br/><br/>Therefore, rate adaptation is one of the fundamental resource management issues which are used to deal with channel dynamicity.

# Running the code
    There is a MATLAB code and its corresponding live editor code which are tested and evaluated. 
    The Live editor code has block diagrams for easier understanding of the code.
    To run the code, all the files included in the folder are necessary.

# Dependencies
    Below are the required dependencies to run the code:
    1. Matlab
    2. WLAN toolbox

# Team
    The research team comprsing of the members from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) listed below has developed the algorithms and their implementation.
